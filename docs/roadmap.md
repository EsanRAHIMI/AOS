# Roadmap

> **SUPERSEDED (2026-07-10):** Future direction is now defined exclusively by
> [`master-direction.md`](./master-direction.md) — phases **K1–K5** with hard
> verification gates. Everything below is the historical record of Phases 1–AH.
> **Current phase: K1 — Foundation Reset** (tests, CI, gateway split,
> scope-by-construction, Redis backbone, real auth, 19→6 consolidation).
> No new features, domains, agents, or UI work until K1's gate is green.

   regressions; all typechecks; dashboard build — DONE.

## Phase AA — Scope, Identity & Multi-Tenant Governance Foundation — DONE
(Executed ahead of the Reality-Baseline track; front-loads the identity/tenancy parts of Phase AC/AD.)
1. Scope model (global/tenant/user/project/case) + 16 identity/governance collections — DONE.
2. Central `canAccess` engine at the gateway boundary; missing scope fails closed; denials audited — DONE.
3. Esan seeded as owner/platform governor; legacy login backward compatible via AuthContext mapping — DONE.

   opportunities/systems/presence) on ONE scope-enforced contract (/v1/me/universe) — DONE.
2. Abstract SVG body map (real metrics only; dormant setup-ready nodes) — DONE.
   *(Superseded twice on 2026-07-10: Phase AH replaced the stickman with an anatomical silhouette;
   Phase AH.2 rebuilt it into the Health Intelligence Surface — 14 anatomical regions + 6 systemic
   layers, graded severity, chip rails, layer strip, and compact/full variants — see
   `docs/phase-log.md` Phases AH / AH.2.)*
3. Finance structure (income/expense/bill/installment/obligation/investment) with monthly-normalized
   real math; life/family/home structure; 3 new ingestion kinds — DONE.

   DONE.
5. Old overview preserved as /operations Engine Room; zones honest (live only with real data) — DONE.
6. 18/18 universe smoke + all 7 regression suites; all typechecks; dashboard build — DONE.

## Phase AD — Jarvis Intelligence Core & Living Command Home — DONE (2026-07-09)
Real Jarvis reasoning core (`shared/src/jarvis`) + `/v1/jarvis/*` endpoints + the first
`page.tsx` consumer of the briefing contract. See `phase-log.md` for detail.

## Phase AE — Jarvis Memory, Daily Brain & Real Context Upgrade — DONE (2026-07-09)
Memory-fact ingestion, quality scoring, and the restructured briefing engine
(`primaryPriority`/`activeBlockers`/`systemWarnings`/`recommendedNextActions`).

## Phase AE.1 — Jarvis Priority & Memory Correction — DONE (2026-07-09)
Fixed priority-first response logic so a stated priority is never displaced by a
system warning; broadened memory-fact extraction. See D-related entries in
`decision-log.md`.

## Phase AF.1–AF.4.4 — Living Command Universe, Domain Canvas, Realtime Runtime & Live Activity — DONE (2026-07-09)
The homepage (`/`) became a persistent, realtime command surface: Jarvis
Presence Bar + Focus Row wired to the briefing endpoint, all nine Command
Universe zones given real domain-specific visual renderers (`BodyMap`,
`FinanceFlow`, `HouseholdMap`, `VentureBoard`, `SkillLanes`,
`OpportunityRadar`, `SystemPulse`, `PresenceBadges`, `PriorityStack`), a
domain action layer (accept/reject/ingest controls on zone cards), a
realtime block-invalidation runtime (`UniverseProvider` + SSE), a persistent
`GET /v1/operator/live-state` snapshot that survives refresh/navigation, a
hydration fix for relative timestamps, and a rebuilt Live Activity feed that
groups every operation into one card by stable identity instead of a raw,
duplicated event dump. Full phase-by-phase detail (AF.1 through AF.4.4,
7 sub-phases) is in `phase-log.md`; decisions D-108 through D-128 in
`decision-log.md`.

## Phase AF.5 — Dedicated Per-Domain Routes — DONE (2026-07-09)
Closed the "Command Universe follow-through" gap: every zone's "Open" link now leads to its own
dedicated room (`/health`, `/daily`, `/life`, `/finance`, `/ventures`, `/growth`, `/opportunities`,
`/systems`, `/presence`) built on one shared, comparable template (`DomainRoom`), showing the
complete unsliced record set per domain via a new `GET /v1/me/universe/detail` endpoint, with
"go deeper" links into whichever pre-existing richer page already manages that domain. 29/29 new
smoke + 131/131 regression unchanged. See `phase-log.md`; decisions D-129 through D-131.

## Phase AG — Real Research & Intelligence Fabric — DONE (2026-07-09)
Closed the most-cited gap across every audit document (including the untouched Persian
`TECHNICAL-REPORT.md`): `internet-research-service` had no real web-search API. New
`shared/src/research` provider abstraction (`TavilyProvider`, `webSearchProviderFromEnv`,
`estimateReliability`); `runResearch()` now grounds on real search results with structurally
guaranteed URL integrity (source records are rebuilt from the real results, never trusted from the
LLM's echo); new `sourceMode: 'search_api' | 'llm_only' | 'curated_fallback'` field tracked
separately from the existing `mode`, surfaced as its own badge in the `/research` dashboard pages.
23/23 new smoke + 183/183 cumulative regression. See `phase-log.md`; decisions D-132 through D-135.

## Phase AG.1 — Research Fabric Wired Into Jarvis/Operator — DONE (2026-07-09)
Bug fix, not a redesign: Phase AG built a real Tavily-backed research fabric, but neither
Jarvis-reachable tool actually called it. `find_opportunities` carried a hardcoded
"research provider is not_configured" string regardless of real config; `research_topic` fired an
async fire-and-forget kernel task that replied "Research task started" with no grounded answer in
the same turn. Both now call `internet-research-service` synchronously via a new `dispatchResearch()`
helper in gateway-api and return real findings + `sourceMode` + sources in the same reply; the
goal→tool matcher was also broadened so open topic questions ("find current X trends...") reach
research without requiring the literal word "research". 13/13 new smoke
(`phaseag1-jarvis-research-routing-smoke.mjs`) + all prior suites unchanged. See `phase-log.md`;
decisions D-136 through D-139.

## Phase AG.2 — internet-research-service Reachability — DONE (2026-07-09)
Immediate follow-up bug: AG.1's synchronous wiring surfaced that `internet-research-service` was
never in `scripts/local-services.mjs` — the source of truth for `pnpm dev:all`/`pnpm sync:env` — so
in local dev nothing ever listened on its port and gateway-api got a generic "fetch failed"
regardless of Tavily config. Fixed by adding it to the local service catalog (also added
`code-operator-agent`, found missing from `README-SETUP.md` in the same pass) and replacing the
generic error text with pure, unit-tested classification (`service_unreachable` vs `service_error`
vs `provider_not_configured` vs real success) in `shared/src/research`. 21/21 new smoke
(`phaseag2-research-reachability-smoke.mjs`) + all prior suites unchanged. See `phase-log.md`;
decisions D-140, D-141.

## Carried-forward directions (not yet scheduled or phase-lettered)

These themes from the earlier AA–AE "NEXT" planning are still real and still
pending — they are listed here without phase letters to avoid colliding with
the AA/AB/AC+/AD/AE/AE.1/AF.1–4.4 phases above, which already completed under
those same letters. Assign a fresh phase name only when work actually starts.

**Documentation & environment truth**
1. Keep docs synchronized with the current service/route/collection reality (this audit pass is the first instance of that discipline being applied explicitly).
2. Verify live env/integration status: MongoDB, S3, Dokploy, GitHub, LLM, voice, registry, event bus.
3. Add automated doc-health checks for service map, constants, env examples, and deployment docs.
4. Point Dokploy diagnostics at the live instance and capture parser/endpoint deltas honestly.

**Real research & intelligence fabric**
5. ~~Add a real web search + fetch provider~~ — **DONE, Phase AG** (2026-07-09): `TavilyProvider` +
   `webSearchProviderFromEnv()` (`shared/src/research`), `runResearch()` grounds on real results with
   source-URL integrity guaranteed structurally, honest `sourceMode` tracking. See `docs/phase-log.md`.
6. Still open: research sources aren't yet fed into daily briefing/opportunity scoring/reports; no
   watch-topics scheduler; only one provider (Tavily) is wired though the interface supports more.
   ~~Jarvis/operator tools not actually calling the research fabric~~ — **DONE, Phase AG.1**
   (2026-07-09): `find_opportunities`/`research_topic` now dispatch real synchronous research. See
   `docs/phase-log.md`.

**Multi-user operating layer**
7. Onboard real second users/tenants on top of the Phase AA scope/RBAC skeleton (today only Esan is seeded as owner).
8. Read-only connectors: calendar, email, files/drive, GitHub/projects.
9. User-scoped daily briefing and weekly strategy loops for non-owner users; opportunity engine extended beyond the single-owner case.

**Production hardening & scale**
10. OIDC/OAuth2 login + JWT/session revocation + persistent per-user RBAC (today: env-credential login + signed HMAC cookie).
11. Redis-backed rate limits, safe-mode propagation, and session invalidation for multi-instance deploys.
12. Redis Streams or NATS behind event-bus-service for multi-instance SSE fan-out.
13. OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/log correlation; OpenAPI/AsyncAPI generation from shared schemas; contract tests per standard endpoint.

**Governed autonomous execution**
14. LLM-planned goals and LLM-synthesized workspace edit batches through the LLM router.
15. Reviewer/QA loop on workspace promotion branches before PR creation; GitHub PR automation when configured.
